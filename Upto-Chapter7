<h1>Chapter3</h1>
<h2>Adventure begin.</h2>
When Steve Henson Looked at outside, the land is shaking, the spooky sky is turning clear, and all the trees are growing to buildings.
Steve got shock by the views that he saw. He gently rubbed his eyes then open. Everything goes too fast that Steve doesn't have time to think.
He doesn't know what is going on; why is his samll town turning to an urban.
With the question in Steve's mind, he get dress up in a hurry, and carry up his notebook then rush out the door to find his answer.
<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h2>Volcanic Eruption</h2>
When steve got outside he saw a 5 mile long lava flow. Heading towards his neighborhood. It had already engulfed half the city and was on its way to destroying
the other half. Steve jumped in his trick and proceeded to run it into the nearest fire hydrant. He did this at all the fire hydrants in his small gated neighborhood.
Soon the amount of water pouring out of the hydrants was knee deep and provided a liquid barrier that shocked all the flowing lava until it turned into
solid rock and stopped flowing. All of the neighbors came out and thanked and hugged Steve. The neighbors put Steve on their shoulders and carried him around the block.
The HomeOwners Association voted unanimously to change the name of the neighborhood SteveWood and That day September was known from then on as Steve Day.
That year all the kids dressed up as Steve for Halloween.
<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<h2> Fire Alarm </h2>
<p>When Steve was at bed at night time, he heard a fire alarm around his house and got up from his bed.
After he got up, he tried to look out his window, but he did not heard the fire alarm anymore, and he decided to go back to his bed.
During that time, Steve was very confused because he did not know what happened to his village and he waited in his bed to konw the problem.
When he was in bed, he heard a second fire alarm sound and he tried to go out from his bed fastly this time and look out around his house.
He saw many fire workers with their fire equipment and he went there, asked them what happend, and they responded to him there was fire and now they controlled it.
The fire alarm location was in front of Steve house, but he didn't considered it happened in front of his house and then he went back to his house.</p>
<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<h2>Looking for clues</h2>
<p>Steve tried to put this night behind him. This fire was probably an incident. After all, he was so loved and respected in his community for 
saving everyone a few months ago, no one could have had the intention to hurt him. 
However, the more he tried to forget about it, the more he became suspicious of it. How could a fire simply light up like that?
Why did his fire alarm went off, stopped for a while, and then started again? He decided to take a look at his fire alarm, and noticed scratches around it, 
as if someone tried to grab it out of the ceiling and to put it back on a hurry. Now that was definitely not normal. He looked closely for more clues, and 
finally decided to go in front of his house to investigate the location of the fire.
Looking meticulously on and around the burned ground, Steve couldn't stop to overthink this whole affair. Suddenly, a voice took him out of his thoughts:
- "You got what you deserved Steve! Next time, the firefighters won't save you!"
The voice was coming from behind him, and Steve turned around to see who was treatering him.</p>
<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<h2>Good neighbor</h2>
 As Steve turned around trying to see through the darkness a familiar face stared back at him. "Jake....... Jake from State Farm? What are you doing here?"
 "Ever Since you saved the neighborhood, Nobdody appreciates me anymore". "I was the one people used to call when people needed help. But since you saved the
 day I guess im just chopped liver. So I decided to retake the spotlight. Show everyone Even a hero needs to get rescued sometimes." 
 "Geez Jake I didnt know being the Neiborhood problem solver meant so much to you."."How about this well both act like this never happenned and ill tell everyone
 How you covered the fire damage and waived my deductible? That should get you some hero points right?". "Yes but that is nothing compared to what you did
 . I'll always be in your shadow........While youre alive that is......"
