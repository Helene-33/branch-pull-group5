<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>A most peculiar day</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to save the world. <br>
Steve Henson wasn't a superhero, just a regular newspapper writer living in West Creekston, a hilly, spooky little town in Northern Scotland. <br>
One day, the young journalist woke up with an odd feeling; today was surely gonna be a different day. <br>
He couldn't say why, but he knew it. He got up and looked through the windows of his bedroom, and what he saw outside in the sky took his breath away.</p>

<h1> Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>An interesting year</h2
<p> There was a man who played soccer. <br>
John David was not a single person, he counted as two or more person when he played soccer at the the age of 25. <br>
At the age of 32, this man and his club became champions at the first time, and during the time, this man was a very good player and he got recognition. <br>
After 6 months, he become a second champion within a year, and after he got it, he became very interested, and he said it was an interesting year.<p>

<h1>Chapter3</h1>
<h2>Adventures begin</h2>
<p>When Steve Henson looked at outside, the land was shaking, the spooky sky was turning clear, and all the trees were growing to buildings.
Steve got shocked by the view that he saw. He gently rubbed his eyes then opened them. Everything was going too fast that Steve didsn't have time to think.
He doesn't know what was going on; why was his small town was turning to an urban city?
With the question in Steve's mind, he dressed up in a hurry, and carried his notebook while rushing out the door to find the answer.</p>

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h2>Volcanic Eruption</h2>
<p>When Steve got outside, he saw a 5 mile long lava flow heading towards his neighborhood. It had already engulfed half the city and was on its way to destroying
the other half. Steve jumped in his truck and proceeded to run it into the nearest fire hydrant. He did this at all the fire hydrants in his small gated neighborhood.
Soon the amount of water pouring out of the hydrants was knee-deep and provided a liquid barrier that shocked all the flowing lava until it turned into
solid rock and stopped flowing. All of the neighbors came out and thanked and hugged Steve. The neighbors put Steve on their shoulders and carried him around the block.
The HomeOwners Association voted unanimously to change the name of the neighborhood to SteveWood and that day, September was known from then on as Steve Day.
That year, all the kids dressed up as Steve for Halloween.</p>

<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<h2> Fire Alarm </h2>
<p>When Steve was in bed at night time, he heard a fire alarm around his house and got up from his bed.
After he got up, he tried to look out his window, but he did not hear the fire alarm anymore, and he decided to return to his bed.
During that time, Steve was very confused because he did not know what happened to his village and he waited in his bed to find out the problem.
When he was in bed, he heard a second fire alarm sound and he tried to run out from his bed quickly this time to look out around his house.
He saw many fire workers with their fire equipment and he went there, asked them what happened, and they responded to him there was a fire and now they controlled it.
The fire alarm location was in front of Steve house, but he didn't considered it happened in front of his house and then he went back to his house.</p>

<h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<h2>Looking for clues</h2>
<p>Steve tried to put this night behind him. This fire was probably an incident. After all, he was so loved and respected in his community for 
saving everyone a few months ago; no one could have had the intention to hurt him. 
However, the more he tried to forget about it, the more he became suspicious of it. How could a fire simply light up like that?
Why did his fire alarm go off, stop for a while, and then start again? He decided to take a look at his fire alarm and noticed scratches around it, 
as if someone tried to grab it out of the ceiling and to put it back in a hurry. Now that was definitely not normal. He searched closely for more clues, and 
finally decided to go in front of his house to investigate the location of the fire.
Looking meticulously on and around the burned ground, Steve couldn't stop to overthink this whole affair. Suddenly, a voice took him out of his thoughts:
- "You got what you deserved Steve! Next time, the firefighters won't save you!"
The voice was coming from behind him, and Steve turned around to see who was threatening him.</p>

<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
<h2>Good neighbor</h2>
 <p>As Steve turned around trying to see through the darkness, a familiar face stared back at him. "Jake... Jake from State Farm? What are you doing here?"
 "Ever since you saved the neighborhood, nobody appreciates me anymore. I was the one people used to call when people needed help. But since you saved the
 day I guess im just chopped liver. So I decided to retake the spotlight. Show everyone even a hero needs to get rescued sometimes." 
 "Geez Jake, I didnt know being the "neighborhood problem solver" meant so much to you," said Steve. "How about this? We'll both act like this never happened 
 and I'll tell everyone how you covered the fire damage and waived my deductible. That should get you some hero points, right?" "Yes, but that is nothing 
 compared to what you did. I'll always be in your shadow... While you're alive that is..."</p>
 
<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
<h2>Only Space for One</h2>

<p>After hearing Jake’s ominous one-liner, he agreed, nodding his head frantically. 
“Okay, okay!”
Jake smirked before he turned around and disappeared into the streets.
For a few minutes after, Steve walked around on his lawn, clearly in distress. Suddenly, he caught a distinct smell he hadn’t noticed earlier. A clue changed everything. 
It was gasoline and the undeniable evidence he could make use of. He smiled to himself.
The next morning, Steve sat on his porch, sipping a chilled lemonade while a shocked Jake stumbled out of the house across the street. 
Police cars surrounded him, and handcuffs were slapped on his wrists. Jake snarled at Steve, who just chuckled darkly to himself. 
The headlines would later speak of how Jake, the seemingly good Samaritan of the neighborhood had committed arson on his own neighbor.
“There’s only space for one hero here,” Steve whispered to himself before walking back into his house.</p>

<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
<h2>Just a dream</h2>
<p>Watching the police car gradually leave his sight, Steve was feeling satisfied.
Finally, he became what he wanted; a hero, a man who saves the world!
Steve walked back to his house. Now, the only thing that he wanted was to take a nap, because he hadn't slept well those days.
Steve laid on his bed and then fell asleep.</p>
......
</p>"John David got his second championship of this year..."
The TV is reporting how a soccer player got his championship two times in one year.
Steve woke up on his couch, he looked around his house, then glanced outside.
"Well, it was just a dream." Steve wryly smiled to himself. "But it was a cool dream, I better write it down!"
Steve grabbed his pen and notebook and started writing his fantasy dream.</p>
