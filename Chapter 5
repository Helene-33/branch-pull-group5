<p>When Steve was at bed at night time, he heard a fire alarm around his house and got up from his bed.
After he got up, he tried to look out his window, but he did not heard the fire alarm anymore, and he decided to go back to his bed.
During that time, Steve was very confused because he did not know what happened to his village and he waited in his bed to konw the problem.
When he was in bed, he heard a second fire alarm sound and he tried to go out from his bed fastly this time and look out around his house.
He saw many fire workers with their fire equipment and he went there, asked them what happend, and they responded to him there was fire and now they controlled it.
The fire alarm location was in front of Steve house, but he didn't considered it happened in front of his house and then he went back to his house.</p>

<h2>Looking for clues</h2>
<p>Steve tried to put this night behind him. This fire was probably an incident. After all, he was so loved and respected in his community for 
saving everyone a few months ago, no one could have had the intention to hurt him. 
However, the more he tried to forget about it, the more he became suspicious of it. How could a fire simply light up like that?
Why did his fire alarm went off, stopped for a while, and then started again? He decided to take a look at his fire alarm, and noticed scratches around it, 
as if someone tried to grab it out of the ceiling and to put it back on a hurry. Now that was definitely not normal. He looked closely for more clues, and 
finally decided to go in front of his house to investigate the location of the fire.
Looking meticulously on and around the burned ground, Steve couldn't stop to overthink this whole affair. Suddenly, a voice took him out of his thoughts:
- "You got what you deserved Steve! Next time, the firefighters won't save you!"
The voice was coming from behind him, and Steve turned around to see who was treatering him.</p>
