<h1>Chapter3</h1>
<h2>Adventure begin.</h2>
When Steve Henson Looked at outside, the land is shaking, the spooky sky is turning clear, and all the trees are growing to buildings.
Steve got shock by the views that he saw. He gently rubbed his eyes then open. Everything goes too fast that Steve doesn't have time to think.
He doesn't know what is going on; why is his samll town turning to an urban.
With the question in Steve's mind, he get dress up in a hurry, and carry up his notebook then rush out the door to find his answer.

<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
<h2>Volcanic Eruption</h2>
When steve got outside he saw a 5 mile long lava flow. Heading towards his neighborhood. It had already engulfed half the city and was on its way to destroying
the other half. Steve jumped in his trick and proceeded to run it into the nearest fire hydrant. He did this at all the fire hydrants in his small gated neighborhood.
Soon the amount of water pouring out of the hydrants was knee deep and provided a liquid barrier that shocked all the flowing lava until it turned into
solid rock and stopped flowing. All of the neighbors came out and thanked and hugged Steve. The neighbors put Steve on their shoulders and carried him around the block.
The HomeOwners Association voted unanimously to change the name of the neighborhood SteveWood and That day September was known from then on as Steve Day.
That year all the kids dressed up as Steve for Halloween.
