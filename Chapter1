<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
<h2>A most peculiar day.</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a man who wanted to save the world. <br>
Steve Henson wasn't a superhero, just a regular newspapper writter living in West Creekston, a hilly, spooky little town in Northern Scotland. <br>
One day, the young journalist woke up with an odd feeling; today was surely gonna be a different day. <br>
He couldn't say why, but he knew it. He got up and looked throught the windows of his bedroom, and what he saw outside in the sky took his breath away.</p>
